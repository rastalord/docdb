KidEchoCardio21 Dataset Description
The KidEchoCardio21 consists of 19,884 Doppler echocardiography medical reports from children from 1 month up to 18 years old categorized by 11 most common diagnoses (Signs of CHD, IVS defect, Defect of oval window, 
Dysplastic cardiopathy, Sports-adapted heart, Dysplastic changes, Dysplastic cardiopathy, dysplastic cardiopathy, Mitral valve prolapse, Signs of autonomic imbalance). This dataset has been anonymized in order to remove individually identifiable protected health information. The KidEchoCardio21 dataset is suitable for clinical and/or methodological research and publications purposes. It contains one record per Doppler echocardiography procedure and includes examination results that allow for assessments of relationships of variables with outcomes, as well as examination of time trends. The dataset includes approximately 20,000 Doppler echocardiography procedures in more than 18,000 unique patients.

Valuable difference from others datasets in the branch (i.e. CHD dataset, SAheart and Hungarian Institute of Technology Heart disease dataset) are age group of the patients and formalized structure of dataset itself which can give insight on which parameter has actual importance in the decision making process of a doctor (because the actual picture has much more data than is represented in report, however the diagnosis is approved and treatment is provided exactly according to report).
